            <p> Hello, my name is Thanos and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. Ever since I was a child I was fascinated by computers, that is why in 8th grade I decided to pick up a C++ book and study it as a hobby. To me implementing the things I read there on the computer and seeing it respond to my code was something out of this world. So here I am a few years later with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (<i>with a specialization in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Systems</i>) doing something I feel like I was born to do.  </p>
