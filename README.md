# My personal portfolio made using HTML , CSS and JS
 Things I used:
 * HTML and CSS for the main Structure
 * Bootstrap for styling
 * Javascript to get responsive design on Bootstrap elements that did not have it
 * Animate.css and JQuery(with Waypoints) for animations
 * Ion Icons for the down arrow icon on the hero screen
